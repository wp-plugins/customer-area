All the screenshots where done on a WordPress 3.6 development site, using the base Twenty Thirteen theme. No other
customisation has been done to the plugin or to the add-ons.
	
	
== Upgrade Notice ==

= Upgrading from 3.x to 4.x =

Version 4 introduces a brand new menu system and breaks many templates that have been there in version 3.x. Coming 
from that version, you will need to create the pages that are necessary to display the private content types. Before
upgrading the plugin, backup your files and database. It is advised that you attempt the upgrade on a development 
site first.



= Upgrading from 2.x to 3.x =

Because version 3 introduces a new layout for the customer area, template files for displaying files and pages 
have been renamed and reorganised. If you have customized them, be warned that you will need to change your 
customized files to reflect the changes! In that case, first do the upgrade on a development site, not on your live 
website. And as always:

1. Backup your database
2. /!\ IMPORTANT - Update all the Customer Area extensions FIRST
3. Update the Customer Area plugin

= Upgrading from 2.x to 2.3.0 =

Make sure to backup your database. Some important changes have been made to the ownership system and even though we have
tested our upgrade script as much as we could, you might find yourself with owners of posts reset to nobody.

1. Backup your database
2. /!\ IMPORTANT - Update all the Customer Area extensions FIRST
3. Update the Customer Area plugin

= Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x =

You must also upgrade all the add-ons you are using.

== Installation ==

1. Nothing special, just upload the files, activate and you can then visit the settings page if you want. Like any 
other plugin
1. You need then to create a page and insert the [customer-area] shortcode. Your customers will be able to access their
private content on that page.
1. Finally, you will need to create content for the users (!): you can start with a private file for instance. Just 
check out the WordPress menu in your administration panel, you can add new customer files just like any post. Simply 
upload a file (below the content box), set the owner of that file, publish, and your customer should be able to see it.  

== Screenshots ==

01. The customer area for logged-in customer "Gail". Files are grouped by categories. A click on the category title 
expands the panel. Currently shown is the "Invoices" category.
02. The customer area for logged-in customer "Gail". Files are grouped by categories. A click on the category title 
expands the panel. Currently shown is the "Product Samples" category.
03. The detail page for a private file. You can see the title, description and download links. 
04. The detail page for a private file. Same page as in the previous screenshot, except that we have scrolled down
to show that you can also comment on a private file, you can then have a discussion with your customer about that
particular file
05. The private file edition page. You can have a title, description, attach a file and set the owner easily, as in any
other WordPress admin screen
06. The main settings screen.
07. The private files settings screen.
08. The login screen when the login form add-on is enabled.
09. The lost password screen when the login form add-on is enabled. Also shows the integration with the Really Simple
CAPTCHA plugin.
10. The registration screen when the login form add-on is enabled. Also shows the integration with the Really Simple
CAPTCHA plugin.
11. Send a notification to your customer when you create a new private file (see top-right box). You need to enable
the notifications add-on.
12. The settings screen when the notifications add-on is enabled.
13. The rest of the settings screen when the notifications add-on is enabled.

== Changelog ==

= 4.0.1 (2014/02/16) =

* Fixed: normal WordPress pages could not be added to any navigation menu

= 4.0.0 (2014/02/15) =

**THIS IS A MAJOR UPDATE - PLEASE MAKE SOME TESTS ON YOUR DEVELOPMENT AND TEST SITES BEFORE UPGRADING YOUR LIVE WEBSITE**

* Completely changed the way information is displayed in the frontend. Now the plugin uses a system of pages similar to the one used by WooCommerce for example. 
This has allowed greater possibilities for customization (Widget areas, more templates to override, ...)
* The customer area main navigation menu now is a WordPress menu that can be customized just like any other WordPress menu (from the admin page: "Appearance" > "Menus")
* Restructured the options page. It now has less tabs and should group options in a more logical way. If you have commercial add-ons, you may need to enter their
license key again. These are available by logging-in with your credentials at http://www.marvinlabs.com/shop/your-account/
* Added category column in the admin page for private files and private pages (A pending feature request from several users)
* Refactored a lot of code to make the plugin ligher and more efficient. Should also reduce the amount of duplicated code and thus the potential hidden bugs. 
* Add possibility to include a function file in your Customer Area theme (See included frontend theme: default-v4). Works like WordPress' functions.php file for themes
except that this file should be located in your Customer Area theme folder (not the WordPress theme's folder) and it should be named 'cuar-functions.php'
